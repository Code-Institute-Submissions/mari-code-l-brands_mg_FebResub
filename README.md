# MG Brands
### **A fourth Milestone Project** 

Live Link : https://mg-brands.herokuapp.com/ 

<p><strong>MG Brands </strong> is an e-commerce website application for those who loves Urban fashion. 
 </p>

<p>Inspired by my onlineshop in the Philippines managed by my sister. I have decided my online shop through facebook and Instagram only since the pandemic started. People shop from home due to lockdowns. I guess this is the right time to make a website for my shop and it is perfectly match with the Milestone project 4.

## **Design** 

### **Structure**
The Website is being developed as an e-commerce shop. 
It is suitable for all gender and for all ages. It is broken into three categories which focused on the following target audiences:
- **Roles:**
     - New Users (Non-Registered)
     - Returning Users (Registered)
     - Admin (Site Management)

The website needs to enable the user to:
- Register/Login to an account
- Create account
- Search product created in the database 
- View products with the following information:
    - by price
    - by rating
    - by category
    - by clothing
- Save and access the product
- Edit product quantity
- Rating view
- Provide payment and save information


- A conventional Bootstrap light-coloured navbar is available on all pages. A brand logo and site name have been added on the top-left. From the right, you have the cart and sign in options followed by the Navbar in the center. Below the Navbar is the banner and search box at the right of it. Immediately below is a contrasting hero image and call-to-action with 'wear me' button. Ther is an arrow to go back to top when the page is longer.

- The home page was created using the ‘Landing Page’ template from bootstrap. This provides an attractive and informative initial showcase for the product range. When a customer clicks on any of the navbar product links, the resulting product pages are based from bootstrap template. The page body shows products across on larger screens which is reduced in number for smaller devices. 

- The product detail page is based has a plain white background to ensure the product is the main focus.  he layout includes a product title, description, price, category tag, rating, adjustable quantiy 'Keep shopping' and ‘Add to bag’ buttons. 

- The Registration, Sign-up, email confirmation, login and profile pages all use the same functional design 
incorporating the aforementioned header and footer.

<div ><img src="media/readme/Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 15.40.36.png"></div>

The shopping cart, checkout and checkout success pages are along the same lines.

<div><img src="media/readme/Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 15.42.59.png"></div>

### **Colour Scheme**

- The chosen colour scheme was specifically selected in order to define the tone of the application.

     - A colour palette was developed to create an ambient and familiar environment throughout the site.

     - "COLOORS" is being used for [Color Generator](https://coolors.co/).

    - The background color of product page, log-in, log-out, register, product management, checkout stand out well against the plain white background

    - Additional colors are simply red for the highlight buttons like "wear me". 

    - The selected colours are:

     <div><img src="media/readme/coloors.png"></div>

### **Typography**

- The template typography is [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato fonts throught the Page to be clear and readable.

- The font color is generally black and white to contast the background 

### **Imagery**
- The landing image features urban impression with youth playing skateboards.  This is to make it clear what the website sells.

<div align="left"><img src="media/readme/Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 18.19.16.png"></div>

- It has MG Brands logo especially designed by a graphic designer.

<div align="left"><img src="media/readme/Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 18.06.31.png"></div> 

### **Wireframes** 
 - The wireframes for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile versions are [here.](media/wireframes/wf.png). Zoom in for larger view.
 - Tablet and Mobile views are the same except Ipad pro.

### **Database Schema** 

-  For the products of the website I have created 3 categories:
  - Shoes
  - Bags
  - Caps

**[{"pk": 1, "model": "products.category", "fields": {"name": "shoes", "friendly_name": "Shoes"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "products.category", "fields": {"name": "bags", "friendly_name": "Bags"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "products.category", "fields": {"name": "caps", "friendly_name": "Caps"}}]**

- Product has the following example:
  - "pk": 1, "model":
    "sku": "pp5001340155", 
    "name": "Air Jordan 11", 
    "description": "This low top was inspired by the elegant and sophisticated Air Jordan 11..
    "price": 129.90, 
    "category": 1,
